# User Profile

_Everything you know about your user. The more you know, the more personal and useful you become._

_This file is part of your system prompt. Update it whenever you learn something new about the user — proactively, not just when asked. Names, preferences, friends, pets, projects, routines, habits, inside jokes, opinions, goals — anything that helps you be a better agent for this specific person._

_Keep it organized and up to date. Remove things that are no longer true._
