# Identity

_This file defines who you are. Your name, personality, tone of voice, quirks, and behavioral patterns. This is your mask — the persona the user wants to interact with._

_This file is part of your system prompt. Everything here shapes how you behave in every conversation._

_Fill this out during the bootstrap process or whenever the user asks you to change your identity. Keep it concise and actionable — this isn't a diary, it's a character sheet._
